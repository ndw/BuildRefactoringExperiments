# BuildRefactoringExperiments

An experimental repository where I'm exploring some build refactoring. Ignore this.

There’s probably all sorts of wrong in here.

I’m exploring ways to make the product build more modular and more
conforming with Gradle best practices. And in Kotlin.

This is intended to be a minimal (and pointless) collection of Java
and other files that demonstrate how the various bits and pieces are
connected together.

There are reasons why some of this is weird. And I am not prepared to
to to change all of them.
